### Add-on for Anki 2.1 

- Limitation: paste media files(images) does not work  (reuse editor code?)
- you need Anki 2.1.10 or newer

- experimental, code needs to be cleaned up, but it seems to work for me.
- use this at your own risk
- this only works if you copy tinymce into the folder of this add-on as tinymce4.
- feedback and improvements are welcome.
