### notes

- Drag&Drop of content is not supported

### config options

- `experimental_paste_support` (default "false"): If true this add-on "cleans" the html as Anki does it and tries to download pasted images the same way Anki would do it. This mostly works as in Anki but small differences remain. Highly experimential. Might fully break in the future. Don't enable this. 
- `font`: (default: "Times New Roman") and `fontSize` (default: "20"): The font and font size used in the extra dialog.
- `tinymce4Hotkey` (default "Ctrl+0"): Hotkey to open the dialog
