<b>update notice: The latest version supports Anki's built-in night mode which was redesigned with Anki version 2.1.20. So this add-on also requires at least 2.1.20 now.</b>

This add-on loads the content of a field from the editor into a new dialog with the wysiwyg html editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE" rel="nofollow">tinymce</a>. To open this editor click the "T5" button or use the shortcut (adjustable from the add-on config).

This editor offers some advanced editing options especially with regard to tables: You can add or delete rows or columns. You can style the table. You can merge cells. You can style the borders and background colors, etc. 

Drag and Drop of content is not supported. You can paste into this dialog. But I would only paste text from my pdf reader or text editor. I wouldn't paste content from websites because (contrary to the Anki editor) images are not downloaded and the html is not cleaned. the html is not cleaned this might cause problems and/or vulnerabilities in the long run.

General point: Use this at your own risk. If you find a problem, bug, or have a bug fix or improvement let me  know <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/41285-extended-table-editor-official-thread?" rel="nofollow">in the official anki support forum</a>, on  <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_jseditor_for_current_field" rel="nofollow">github</a> or on reddit (/u/ijgnord).

Thanks @/u/glutaniamte for pointing me to a way to display the images.
