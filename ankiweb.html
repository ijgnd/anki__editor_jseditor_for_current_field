This add-on loads the content of a field from the editor into a new dialog with the wysiwyg html editor [tinymce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE). 

This editor offers some advanced editing options especially with regard to tables: You can add or delete rows or columns. You can style the table. You can merge cells. You can style the borders and background colors, etc. Besides these table editing features I like that I can resize how images are displayed in Anki. 

Note: Not all functions that you see in the GUI of this dialog are supported. Some have no effect and others throw harmless error messages (like when you try to edit an image). If you can't live with this don't use this add-on.

You can paste text into this dialog (and use it to localize/download images if you enable an experimental feature). But if you are pasting content from an untrusted source I would paste this directly into the Anki editor - I don't know much about about programming in a secure fashion. Also Drag and Drop of content is not supported.

General point: Use this at your own risk. If you find a problem, bug, or have a bug fix or improvement please tell me on  <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_jseditor_for_current_field" rel="nofollow">github</a>. 

Thanks @/u/glutaniamte for pointing me to a way to display the images.
